Project: Abnormal ship behavior : Marija Karoglan Status: Done

Project Overview

The aim of the project is to detect abnormall ship behavior using AIS data. The topic was changed from the original one, that's the reason for the different directory name.
The project was done in Google Colab (Jupyter notebook) and follows the framework given in 'A framework for ship abnormal behaviour detection and classification using AIS data'(H. Rong, A. P. Teixeira, C. Guedes Soares, 2024, Reliability Engineering & System Safety). The framework was adjusted to fit the dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eminserkanerdonmez/ais-dataset). A more detailed process description will be presented during the lecture.
