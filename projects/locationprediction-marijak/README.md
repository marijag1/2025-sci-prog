Location Prediction - Marija Karoglan

Project: Location Prediction Student: Marija Karoglan Status: In Progress

Project Overview

The aim of the project is to create a model that predicts the possible location of a boat after it sends an SOS signal taking into account different variables (time, currents etc.) and balancing different metrics (mathematical equations).
Data which will be used to train the model will be based on public reports of boating incidents as actual data (in regards to coordinates, damages, injuries etc.) is *usually* unavailable.
The formulas as well as impacts of the currents on bodies in water will be sourced from scholastic articles.
