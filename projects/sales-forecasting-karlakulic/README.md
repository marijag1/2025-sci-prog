# Sales Forecasting Using Historical Retail Data

## Project Description
This project focuses on forecasting future retail sales using historical sales data from the Corporación Favorita dataset. The goal is to analyze sales trends and seasonality, build forecasting models, and demonstrate their application in inventory planning.
The project will include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and practical interpretation of results.

## Dataset
The project uses the **Corporación Favorita Store Sales Dataset**, which contains historical daily sales data from a large grocery retailer in Ecuador.
