From the early years of watching Disney movies and the finding out that computers could be incorporated as a new tool, I found that I would be in heaven if I studied hard and dedicated myself to that goal. The path has been extremely challenging but so rewarding. I really can't imagine myself doing anything else for a career. Knowing the tools of the trade is only the beginning of understanding. Learning to utilize those tools to bring the characters to life has been my focus for some time now. Continuing education is very important to me and is one reason I try to stay active in the community by giving and receiving critiques on ACME Animation, 11 Second Club, and even in LinkedIn groups that I belong too. In learning to receive and give critiques, I gain valuable knowledge and appreciation for my craft and it has had an incredible impact on my skills. As I gain a more critical eye, my perceptions and understanding allows me to see more in the work I produce and review. My skills continue to improve and even my critiques at ACME earned the privilege to be a guest lecturer at schools to talk about being a student and working professional to help teachers in their criteria of how they approach students animation education. Being part of the community means also being involved within the community. Along with donating time to helping young animators grow their skills, I also try to attend meetings for ASIFA Hollywood, SIGGRAPH conventions, and the CTNX expo every year! These opportunities afford me the ability to see the latest in technology and keep up with the trends being set for today and tomorrow! I have met a number of friends and continue to grow my network of animators. Meeting and working with new people is always a thrill and I do my best to make the most of it. There are many interests and hobbies that I have that I enjoy when I am not at my computer animating. I think that being a more diverse and active person helps make me a better person, and animator. Swing dancing is one of my favorite pass-times!

I am a son of a coal miner and a home maker, and they encouraged me to go to college and seek my own way. I felt pressured to be a business major and to work with my hands, so I compromised by seeking a graphic design degree while taking as many painting and drawing classes as possible, plus I felt the need to get a philosophy minor. Although I worked under some Logical Positivist philosophy professors, I came out of the program with a more Existentialist world view. Sartre and Camus were my main focus and my paintings and pastels were based on my emotional responses to my friends and surroundings. A Picasso and then a Matisse show at High Museum in Atlanta were great influences on my early work. After completing my BFA I spent about two years in Philadelphia. While there, I started to read a variety of fiction from the beat generation and some new contemporary fiction. Then I moved to Dallas, and Texas is where everything changed about me and my art. I left my art based on emotional content in favor of a conceptual, intellectual bent. I helped to foster that slant through seeking an MA in Arts and Humanities at UTD. There I meet several professors who helped me develop my ideas, but one in particular helped to reinvent my approach. John Pomara is the professor that reminded me that I had rejected the tools of graphic design and those tools were going to waste. I started to incorporate computer based art into my work along the lines of Derrida's deconstructing text theories. Then I traveled to NYC for a week to see the Armoury show. Seeing all that work presented in such a professional setting, the art fair inspired me to use industrial printers and materials. Finally, I felt ready to seek my MFA and I applied to only one school, the University of North Texas. I had my eye on the university for a long time, so I only wanted UNT. Vincent Falsetta and Annette Lawrence were the two artists that I really wanted to work with, but once I found myself in the program, I found that all the painting and drawing professors were very helpful to develop my ideas, style, and work ethic. When I came to the end of my MFA program I had the epiphany that my work was directly linked to my problems with dyslexia. Words have always posed a challenge for me to understand because words partly act as a space between an object and meaning.

I experience life as a constant tension between polarities: Reaching for the sacred but mired in the profane; loving this place and these people but feeling an unrelenting homesickness for a place I've never been; beguiled by beauty yet uncomfortably aware of impending tragedy; nurturing the intentional and reflective life while living in a world of immediate gratification and the practical. Thus, I often feel disoriented. My art flows from this disorientation and my rooted loves--another polarity. I am ever fascinated by embodiment. I trained as a classical sculptor to understand the body and what makes it one of the most beautiful creations on earth. That fascination has grown into the use of space and visual metaphor to explore the social, psychological, and spiritual experience of embodiment.

I began writing Carpe Travel after I left the corporate world and began life as a self-employed public relations and marketing consultant. You see, I started to see life a little differently and needed to change things up. A few years earlier my dad had been diagnosed with aggressive lung cancer and died a few weeks later (yes, weeks). His \u201csomeday I\u2019ll do this or that\u201d never happened. My first \u201csomeday\u201d happened a few months later when I became a causality of the tech bubble bursting and lost my job. It was time to go somewhere. See something new. Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately depending on how you look at it, I had just bought my first house, so I couldn\u2019t really strap on my backpack and \u201ctake off\u201d. So I settled for hitting New Orleans for Jazz Fest. I made my \u201csomeday\u201d list on that trip and started making things happen when I got home. It took a few years to save the cash but by then I also had enough professional experience (and contacts) to make a living doing consulting. And so I do. I\u2019m now married to \u201cThe Husband\u201d and we have two little Princesses, Princess One and Princess Two. You\u2019d think our traveling days would have slowed down, on the contrary. The Princesses are two very well traveled little people who now help map out our destinations and activities. But, there are still those \u201cno kids allowed\u201d trips that continue to be added to the new \u201cmake it happen\u201d list. And so we do a lot of traveling without the kids as well. I mean really, there are a lot of places one just does not want to take kids, albeit I have been known to take them to five-star restaurants and wine tastings.

From the anatomy of their gills to the thrill of reeling in a big one, fish hold the key capable of unlocking the floodgates of dopamine to my brain. I am an avid fisherman and spend the majority of my summers at various bodies of water chasing the thrill of landing the biggest catch. My favorite species to fish for is the largemouth bass because of how hard they fight. The exhilarating feeling of my line sinking deeper into the water as I try to bring the fish onto land truly captivates me. I get so lost in the moments on the bank that I even forget my own needs and can go fishing all day without eating or drinking. When I fish all the chaos in my head grows quiet and my mind narrows in on just me, the line, and the water. Suddenly I become aware of everything else around me. I can hear the chirps of the birds in the trees, I can feel the mud and dirt beneath my feet, and I can smell the wet grasses that come up shallow on the shore. Although I love to catch fish, I hate eating fish. The fishy taste and strange texture found in most cooked fish has offended my taste buds since early childhood. Nearly every time I catch a fish, I will release it back into the wild to enjoy another day. In the spirit of adventuring and testing new waters, I have been enjoying more fish in my diet thanks to the UGA dining halls.

THE MAKING OF A MAGICIAN Heather performed her first gorilla show at age six. Her captivated family watched as she poured a glass of water into her pocket (having pinned a plastic bag inside the lining), she then made her stomach growl like a drum beat (by pulling a radio cord out from under her coveralls and plugging it into the wall socket). After this command performance, her destiny was sealed. When Heather was 20 years old, she followed her heart and ran away with the Pickle Family Circus and became their first Technical Apprentice. That year her dream of performing with the Pickles came true when she was a featured performer in their winter season run at the Palace of Fine Arts Theatre in San Francisco.

I am finishing up my BSN program and I am set to graduate in June 2020 along with a Double Major in Health Studies from the University of Washington Bothell. I have wanted to gain a more developed public health aspect to enhance my nursing care for the more vulnerable patient populations that I care for in the hospital setting such as the homeless. That being said, my interests in public health is to figure out how to better help more vulnerable populations outside of the hospital setting within my individual practice as a healthcare professional in the hospital setting. Before I became an RN, I worked as a CNA in a memory care unit at an assisted living facility where I was able to work with residents who have various severity dementia levels for about 4 years.

I would also like to become more involved in creating health policies, especially for those involving vulnerable populations. As a part of my previous academic experience in health, I found my interest in policies by creating a research paper about the DSHS CARE Tool that is used to help people with serious medical conditions or disability to get adequate one-on-one care hours paid for by the state of Washington. It was found that psychological medical conditions were not analyzed the same way as physical medical conditions even though both medical conditions can drastically affect how people live outside of the hospital environment.

My first career was in EMS working as an EMT. I was ready to take the exam for paramedic when I had a career ending injury. I tried my hand at dispatching but it wasn't for me. I returned to school and found my new passion. I earned a Bachelor's degree from Drexel University in Behavioral and Addictions counseling. This gave me the opportunity to start my new career in mental health with Horizon House Inc. I've been working with Horizon House since October 2007 at their Community Crossroads Peer Support Center site. When I started with Community Crossroads I was working on my Master's degree in Psychology at University of Phoenix. The online experience was very challenging and having this advanced degree has already opened doors for me. Working at Community Crossroads has been both challenging and enlightening. It gives me the opportunity to combine my scholastic knowledge and the real life knowledge I have gained from learning how to deal with my Bipolar disorder. Community Crossroads operates like a \"drop-in\" center. Everyone who comes is there voluntarily, and everyone who comes is in a different place in their recovery. Some are very active in their recovery others are there for \"a place to be\" because they're also dealing with homeless issues. I'm still with Community Crossroads but was promoted to Recovery Support Coordinator in April. I am now the coordinator in charge of the CommonGround project. CommonGround is a web based program designed by Pat Deegan (if you don't know who she is, look her up. Her story is incredible - you can also go to patdeegan.com). CommonGround is designed to help mental health consumers communicate more effectively with their treatment team...primarily their psychiatrist. In addition, there is a HUGE resource library attached to the program. All resources have been verified for reliable content and all contain very little to no advertising. Coordinating this program has been a challenge beginning with when we worked to educate the providers about the report and how it can improve their relationship with the mental health consumers they treat. Personally, I'm easy going but I hate when people are fake. I also don't like stereotyping or oppression. I get especially frustrated with the way people with a mental illness and those who are homeless are treated. I have advocated in many areas for many people. I prefer open minded people who are not afraid to speak their mind about injustices where ever those injustices occur. There are many people who are in need and who do not know how to seek out that help. Many need an advocate and I am proud to call myself one. I especially like others who will do the same. I've been accused at times of going too far. I don't think there is such a thing as too far when an individual truly wants help and is doing everything they can do to try...a break and some support need to come from somewhere. Mind you, I'm talking about people who are trying to get better and/or better their own life. As far as me going too far, if it helps it's worth it...even if I go through a period of time where things may be uncomfortable for me. If it's the right thing to do, then it's the right thing to do.

In 1968 at 14 Years Old The band's trombonist Belly gave Chino informal lessons during rehearsal breaks and it wasn't long before Chino formed his first band on the Lower East Side, simply called Chino Rodriguez and his Orchestra in 1968-69. Like most young bands, they rehearsed incessantly with paid gigs here and there, usually the round of weddings, birthdays, and private parties familiar to every young band. After high school Chino studied improvisation with the late Barry Rogers and Jose Rodriguez, trombonist in Eddie Palmieri's band. \"Barry Rogers and Jos\u00e9 Rodriguez... were the very best Salsa trombonists of the late 60's and early 70's\", Chino said in a 2010 interview. \"Between the two it was like going to Harvard and Yale. Barry taught me improv and sight reading and Jos\u00e9 taught me breathing and tone with power.\" That early playing experience inspired him to continue working with many bands and companies, large and small, within the music industry in the late '60s and '70s. He met Salsa artists and producers Larry and Andy Harlow and would often sing coro at their gigs. At parties and clubs all over the city Chino met and networked with Latin music pioneers such as Harvey Averne, the late Jerry Masucci, Ralph Mercado, and Jos\u00e9 Cubello. Chino told music journalist Ian Morrison, \"Back in the day once I started hanging out with Larry Harlow, things started to happen, I got more focused and since I met a lot of the promoters / club owners I started getting more work around the New York Area. In the 1970s heyday of Latin music in New York you had to be good to 'cut the mustard.' Chino moved to Florida in 2002 to use his new knowledge base and reconnect with the Tropical Salsa business. Chino's Booking Agency aquired many artist among his new clients was Emmy-winning Latino comedian Mike Robles, who grew up in the same area of Manhattan as Chino (as well as Jennifer Lopez). Chino booked Mike at college campuses throughout the country during Hispanic History Month and Latin heritage celebrations. \"Chino is smart, and he definitely knows how to market an artist\", Mike said in 2010. \"I was impressed by his passion for what he does.

I have always been a writer, although my early critics didn't warm to my style 'minus 1 House-point, Weird' was my teacher's initial response. Undiscouraged, I continued to write about puking black sick after my First Holy Communion and my mother's saints - Padre Pio and his visions of demons. As the daughter of an Irish mother and fisherman father I come from a place where stories are scarce, sacred and alive. I took this place with me when I studied for my MA Honours in English Literature and Language at St Andrews. This was a furnace learning experience - forging skills I have used everyday since in arts, culture, education and business. Who we are as learners, how we learn and what we learn - are the crucial questions which have shaped my career. I have taught angry teenagers; unemployed men; cast out women; little poets; big dreamers in a variety of settings from formal education to the wild woods. What I teach is mostly how to learn using creative writing as a route in. My journey took me to ARC, an arts centre in the North East. Here I researched, designed and sourced funding for creative learning projects which tapped into the unique learning experiences the creative process can provide. Still orbiting learning I landed in Higher Education as a Community Engagement Coordinator - supporting the Third Sector to access digital learning. I then made the leap into Industry Engagement - researching and successfully sourcing funding for international projects which explored the space between what education provides and what industry needs for the digital sector. In each of these roles I employed all of the skills of story - understanding people; communicating a message; building a case; honest scrutiny; re-learning and making something of value. In 2013, after having encouraged so many individuals to take the leap towards independence, I took my own advice and became a Freelance Writer. My writer's story started young and when I picked up the thread again, my first manuscript 'How Saints Die' won New Writing North's Northerm Promise Award 2012 (not my only award, at 8yrs I won a Curly-wurly). How Saints Die will be published with Harvill Secker on 13th July 2017. I've performed poetry to a sell out show at the Southbank Centre during the Festival of Neighbourhood 2013.
