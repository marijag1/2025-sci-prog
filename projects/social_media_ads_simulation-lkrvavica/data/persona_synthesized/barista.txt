I am currently a Journalism and Media and Communication student at Deakin Universtity. I hope that my studies would lead towards a career in the industry of publication in the areas of make-up, fashion, beauty or sport. In my spare time, I work as a Barista and model. Coffee is an art and modelling is a passion that I greatly respect. Making coffee is something that i love doing and almost a gift i love giving. There's nothing i enjoy more than seeing a person take their first sip of the day and exhale a sigh of satisfaction. I do have a great appreciation for cars. I think they are immaculate creations that should be taken advantage of. You could find me modelling or doing promo-work at a lot of car shows, just to squeeze in a perve at impressive European vehicles. I love sport. I love watching and being a part of it. I love competition and i love adrenalin. Rugby, football and volleyball would be the ultimate sports in my eyes and the main sports worth watching as well as playing. You will usually find me on my phone or ipod tapping away into games such as sodoku, solitaire, chess or 4pics1word. Games that stimulate thinking, problem solving and strategic planning take preference above all else.
