I am a writer, editor, publisher, and social media strategist. At my company, Crackerjack Scribe, I help businesses enhance their online presence through authentic content and effective social media strategies. At Crackerjack Scribe, we offer a variety of services, including website design, editing, writing, as well as social media and content marketing consultation and training. I previously served as the Associate Publisher and Editor of the weekly newspaper, The Malibu Times, and the bimonthly lifestyle publication, Malibu Times Magazine. In addition to my professional work, I have a passion for dancing the Argentine tango. You can check out my website, Coffee and Tango. I also write for several blogs and maintain my interest in journalism by contributing to the Los Angeles Times newspaper group.
