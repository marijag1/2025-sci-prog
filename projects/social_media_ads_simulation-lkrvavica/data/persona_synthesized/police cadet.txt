Contact me here if you're so inclined. If you want to hear what I'm listening to, go here to see my Bandcamp collection! A bit difficult to meet people here except as a way to trade business cards, but that's alright... I came across about.me many years ago when it was just starting up, and I used the site as a digital business card of sorts. Seeing how creative others have been with theirs, I feel a bit silly for putting up what sounds like a stodgy page. Now, for a simple introduction, though broken down a bit because I do a lot of stuff... First and foremost, I am a teacher based in Tbilisi, Georgia, with a background of teaching English (ESL, ELA, AP), History, Geography, Music Appreciation, and Film & Media classes.
