I am a Registered Nurse who has earned her ADN at Everett Community College. I am finishing up my BSN program and I am set to graduate in June 2020 along with a Double Major in Health Studies from the University of Washington Bothell. I have wanted to gain a more developed public health aspect to enhance my nursing care for the more vulnerable patient populations that I care for in the hospital setting such as the homeless. That being said, my interests in public health is to figure out how to better help more vulnerable populations outside of the hospital setting within my individual practice as a healthcare professional in the hospital setting. Before I became an RN, I worked as a CNA in a memory care unit at an assisted living facility where I was able to work with residents who have various severity dementia levels for about 4 years. I have been an RN since January 2019 and currently work on a renal-telemetry acute care hospital unit at a major hospital. I am eager to continue to grow and learn in my current role as a Med-Surg RN. I aim to develop professionally by gaining experience to be able to apply to a DNP program where I can further develop what I have learned as an RN and improve my leadership and care management skills. I would also like to become more involved in creating health policies, especially for those involving vulnerable populations. As a part of my previous academic experience in health, I found my interest in policies by creating a research paper about the DSHS CARE Tool that is used to help people with serious medical conditions or disability to get adequate one-on-one care hours paid for by the state of Washington. It was found that psychological medical conditions were not analyzed the same way as physical medical conditions even though both medical conditions can drastically affect how people live outside of the hospital environment. As a result, I emailed Washington State Legislation about this issue and it is currently under review.
