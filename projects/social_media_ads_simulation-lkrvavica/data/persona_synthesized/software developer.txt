Hello! I'm a junior computer science student, eager to create. I'm a huge Bruce Lee fan, and an avid innovator. I love programming, I love bringing a project from concept to reality. I love hearing from like minded people, so feel free to contact me, there is an email link below. Roomi - Roomi is a Housing Review Application for Columbia, currently a work in progress. It is built on top of meteor, and backbone. Swap College - SwapCollege is an attempt at strengthening Columbia's sense of community by giving it tools to help students communicate. Version 1 of SwapCollege consisted of polls, teacher evaluations, file sharing, a reddit clone, and class discussions. We created something which was useful, but was on the complicated side. For our second iteration we decided to take a much simpler approach, where a student simply searches a course within Columbia's directory and is given as much information as possible pertaining to that course. (Closed Source) Hearst - Is a web application I am building which hopes to create a platform in which campus groups, and their members can talk more efficiently with one another. Students are generally oblivious to the cool things other student's are doing, hopefully hearst will be able to change that. To.day - To.day is an HackNYC hackathon hack, which attempts to give you an extremely brief over view of people and things mentioned in the nytimes. It allows you to get a detailed analysis of a specific topic, with links to the original sources, quotes from the articles, and analytics on their use. The lack of available indexing on Heroku's new Cedar platform slows down the intial page load, but you can still see the concept.
