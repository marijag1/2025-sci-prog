# Social media ads simulation - Lara Krvavica

**Project:** Social media ads simulation
**Student:** Lara Krvavica
**Status:** In Progress

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project develops a **simulation environment that models how users interact with online advertisements** using agent-based modeling and machine learning.  
Each user is represented as an autonomous agent with unique personality traits, behavioral tendencies, and social characteristics.  
Advertisements are represented as structured objects containing descriptive features such as topic, tone, color, and message style.

The simulation generates synthetic interaction data — agents react to ads by liking, clicking, ignoring, or sharing — and these interactions are logged and used to train a predictive model.  
The model learns from individual behaviors to estimate how **groups of similar users** are likely to respond to specific advertisements.

The goal of the project is to explore **how to optimize ad exposure across user groups** to maximize engagement, while also building a realistic dataset that mimics social media ad dynamics.  
By combining behavioral simulation and machine learning, the project provides insights into **digital marketing effectiveness**, **user segmentation**, and **adaptive content targeting**.

## 🎯 Goal and Hypothesis

**Goal:**  
To simulate the dynamic interaction between users and digital ads, and to quantify how different user groups respond to different types of advertisements.

**Core Research Question**  
Which user group (by age, gender, interests, or interaction history), and to what extent, should be targeted with a given ad in order for the campaign to be successful?

**Hypothesis:**  
> If users are grouped according to their characteristics and behavioral tendencies, their response to advertisements can be predicted significantly better than by random distribution, using classical machine learning models.
