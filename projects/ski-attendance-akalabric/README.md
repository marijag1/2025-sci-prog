# Weather-Based Ski Resort Attendance Predictor

## Project Description
This project analyzes the relationship between weather conditions and ski resort attendance.
The goal is to predict daily attendance levels (low, medium, high) based on meteorological and calendar features.

## Research Questions
- How do temperature and snowfall affect ski resort attendance?
- Are weekends and holidays associated with higher attendance?
- Which weather variables are the strongest predictors of attendance?

## Data
- Weather data: public weather APIs (historical daily data)
- Attendance data: synthetic / proxy data generated for research purposes

## Methods
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

## Tools
Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn
